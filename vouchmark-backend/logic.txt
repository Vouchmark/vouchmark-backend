So i want to get the price/amount the user will pay, there is the default price ofcourse but in a case where by the user is on a active plan such as monthly plan and want to either upgrade to bussiness (yearlypan) or want to purchase anothe rmonthly plan. even if the current active plan hasn't finished we want to cater for this. NB: getting the active plan is checking the current date and making sure it is still active and if there is active then the below occurs:

So basically for purchasing another monthly plan, only if the current active plan is monthly, we get the current date he has used since the start date. and add 30 days to the end date, therey extending the date. the price remains the monthly price (the default)
- for upgrading to yearly plan, that is current active plan is month, it gets the current date, (calcuates amount for each day based on the total amount price for the month). then it calculates how much has been used up until the current date and substract that amount from the yearly plan price to give the price to pay. and ofcourse the start date will then be current date and end date be 365 plus.
- for adding a yearly plan, only if current plan is yearly, similar to adding montly plan, we get the current date he has used since the start date. and add 365 days to the end date, therey extending the date. the price remains the bussiness(yearly) price (the default)
